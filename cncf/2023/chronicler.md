# The Chronicler

Ensure that your security documentation contains properly formatted data related to software supply chain security decisions. This includes providing instructions for end users looking to validate provenance artifacts.

Goals:

- [ ] Ensure that your project's SBOM is accurate and up to date with the lastest release
- [ ] Ensure that your project's dependency consumption policy is clearly written and up to date
- [ ] Ensure that the locations of both are documented in your [SECURITY-INSIGHTS.yml](https://github.com/ossf/security-insights-spec/blob/main/specification.yml)
